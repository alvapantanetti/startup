Using the following css:

* {
    font: Verdana, Arial, 'sans-serif' !important; <!-- fonts -->
}

The * selector means any/all elements, but will obviously be on
the bottom of the food chain when it comes to overriding more specific selectors.

The !important flag will render the font-style for * to be absolute, even if other
selector have been used to set the text.

the !important flag would prevent other selectors from overriding, as long as they
don't also use it.
